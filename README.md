##  TADKit

Time-series Anomaly Detection Kit with Interactivity and Tools

A toolkit integrating and wrapping all anomaly detection components with a possibility to: interact between the various components (preprocessing, engeering, modeling) interact with a visualization/annotation tool (e.g. Debiai) via an API intended for expert-in-the-loop iterations

The component is referenced by the [European Trustworthy AI Foundation] in its [catalog]

## Documentation

The full documentation is available in the [web site]

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT_v2.md).

## Quality check

Several tools are used for maintaining the quality of the python library, such as code formatting, linting, testing, documentation, and security analysis:
1. Code Formatting: [Black] is an opinionated Python code formatter that automatically formats your code to make it consistent. It helps reduce debates about code style by enforcing a standard format.
2. Linting (Code Quality Checks): [Flake8] is A wrapper around PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and mccabe that provides an easy-to-use interface for linting Python code.
[//]: # ([Pylint] is a widely used linter for Python that checks for errors in Python code, enforces coding standards, and looks for potential code smells.)
3. Testing: [pytest] is a framework that makes it easy to write simple as well as scalable test cases. It also supports fixtures, parameterization, and many plugins.

## Installation

This component is available with pip or as a Docker image. To install it, you can follow the [installation guide].


# Developer Area

## Get started

Please have a look at [the Sphinx documentation]

## Generate docs

````
pip install -r docs/docs_requirements.txt -r requirements.txt
sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/generated tadkit
sphinx-build -M html docs/source docs/build -W --keep-going
````

## Tests

````
# Move into whichever directory you want to serve
cd ./docs/build/html

# Start the http server 
python -m http.server 8080
````

## build and locally run the docker 

````
docker build -t tadkit .
docker run --rm tadkit python main.py
````

## build and locally run the python lib

````
pip install setuptools wheel

# installs your library in "editable" mode, 
# meaning changes you make to the code will be immediately reflected without needing to reinstall.
pip install -e .
# OR 
pip install .

# check if the library is successfully installed 
pip list | grep tadkit
````
